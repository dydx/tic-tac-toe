// need a method via jQuery that gets the `data-cell` # from a clicked
// element and push it into the correct player's array

// need to be able to handle whos move it is. we can do this by
// incremementing a counter from 1 to n, and if the counter is
// odd, its player one's move... even, player two's move


// playerState = 1
// while playGame {
//
// }


// need to be able to insert the right icon when a player makes their move
